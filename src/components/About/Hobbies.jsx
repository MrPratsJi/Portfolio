            In my free time, I love indulging in activities that keep me active
            and relaxed. One of my favorite pastimes is playing cricketâ€”I enjoy
            the teamwork, strategy, and adrenaline rush that comes with being on
            the field. Music is another passion of mine; it helps me unwind and
            sets the perfect mood after a long day. I also find swimming
            incredibly refreshing, as it keeps me fit while allowing me to have
            fun. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also help me maintain a
            balanced and fulfilling lifestyle
